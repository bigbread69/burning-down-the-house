<PageLayout title="About - Burning Down the House">
	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>Burning Down the House dismantles the hidden mental machinery that keeps people trapped in anxiety, compulsions, self-sabotage and chronic dissatisfaction, even when their lives are objectively fine. It shows—simply and brutally—that freedom isn't achieved by improving yourself, healing yourself, or fixing your mindset, but by removing the interference pattern that hijacks your nervous system and blocks natural flow.</p>
